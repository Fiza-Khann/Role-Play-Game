In Mips Assembly Language - Mars Stimulator

1.	INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND
Introduction:
This project aims to create an RPG game simulation using MIPS Assembly, so that it demonstrates the power of assembly language in simulating game mechanics. It will involve key RPG features such as character creation, combat, leveling up, random events, and item management-all directly implemented in MIPS Assembly.
 
Background:
MIPS Assembly is a sort of assembly language widely used in teaching institutions in order to teach the very basics of how computers work. Although it is not much used for game development, the simplest RPG game in MIPS lets us go through important issues like memory management, processing, and user interaction at a deeper level.
In most RPGs, systems like character stats, turn-based combat, and random events are built on the basis of algorithms and data structures. This project explores how such systems can be implemented in MIPS Assembly, therefore filling in the gap between theory and practical implementation using such an uncommon programming approach.

2.	PROBLEM STATEMENT
It is the purpose of this project to fill the gap in the current market of games that has no text-based RPG game with seamless integration of MIPS architecture. Development of a new MIPS-based text adventure game will, therefore, bring adventure with a classic charm to the new system of game design.

3.	PROPOSED SOLUTION

3.1. FEATURES OF THE PROJECT 
The core mechanics of a simplified RPG experience will be implemented in an RPG game in MIPS Assembly.
•	Character Creation: Create a character with basic stats (health, attack, and defense) to be created by the player him/herself.
•	Combat System: In this case there will be one turn-based combat system concerning player fights between random generated monsters. The system will handle damage calculation and health management.
•	Leveling System: In this case, a player defeats monsters and gains XP before leveling up, which increases health, attack, and defense stats.
•	Random Events: The game will have random events like encounter with the enemy, finding treasure, and resting to recover health.
•	Item Management: The player can collect items such as health potions, which he can use during battles to recover health.
•	Boss Battles: There will be a final battle with a boss, which will be much more powerful and have stats that will be difficult to beat.

3.2. METHODOLOGY 
Development of the RPG game in MIPS Assembly shall be approached in a structured manner, breaking down the game's complexity into smaller modules.
a.	Planning Phase:
•	Identify key game mechanics and features (combat, character stats, item management).
•	Design the structure of the game, including how data (such as character stats and items) will be stored and manipulated in memory.

b.	Design Phase:
•	Develop pseudocode and flowcharts for combat mechanics, random event generation, and other systems.
•	Determine the memory organization and register usage for the game state.

c.	Development Phase:
•	Implement the main game loop, which will include random events, combat, leveling up, and item usage.
•	Implement each module of the game in MIPS Assembly, including the combat system, random event generation, and leveling system.

d.	Testing Phase:
•	Continuously test each module (for example, combat system, random events) for correctness and efficiency.
•	Debugging issues concerning memory management and system calls as MIPS is very sensitive to how registers are used and memory addressed.

e.	Deployment Phase:
•	Assemble the final code and package the game for demonstration or submission.
3.3. TECHNOLOGIES TO BE USED
o	Programming Language: MIPS Assembly Language
o	Development Environment: MIPS Simulator (Mars, QtSpim)
o	Documentation: MS Word for in-code documentation, project reports, and user manuals.
o	ASCII Display: Use to display the game elements on the console, using ASCII characters to reflect the progressing story.

4.	PROJECT SCOPE
The project will be text-based RPG game simulation through MIPS Assembly. It will focus on core RPG elements such as character creation, turn-based combat system, random event generation, leveling mechanics, and item management. The game is simulated entirely through assembly code for a low-level understanding of memory management, randomness, and system calls. It will not contain complex graphical representation, multi-user features, and animation as the game would be made within a text-based interface and under the limitations of MIPS Assembly.

5.	PROJECT ABSTRACT
This project is going to be a Turn-Based RPG Game using MIPS Assembly Language, demonstrating practical uses of low-level programming. The game will include features like character creation, turn-based combat, random events, leveling up, and boss battles. MIPS Assembly's direct memory manipulation and limited resources make it an ideal environment for developing small-scale but engaging games. This project will help to fill the gap between the theoretical learning of assembly language and its real application by offering an interesting platform for students to understand low-level programming with the joy of game development.
